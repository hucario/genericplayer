# NewAnesidora
A complete rewrite of [Anesidora](https://github.com/pvr212/Anesidora).

#### Hold up what happened to the original?
Nothing. [It's still there.](https://github.com/pvr212/Anesidora) I just wanted to remake it.

~~also I can't reupload it to the Chrome Web Store as exactly the same so LOOK GUYS IT'S A DIFFERENT EXTENSION~~

#### What's the difference?
- Doesn't rely on jQuery
- Uses font icons, which makes [this whole mess a lot easier](https://github.com/pvrs12/Anesidora/pull/54) (in my defense, I knew a lot more about it now than I did then)
- Doesn't have to be just Pandora - going to make this work for several streaming services hopefully (although they'll have to be radio based) 
## This is still a WIP, and doesn't actually function at all yet lol
### To-do:


#### Overall:
- Add functionality (as in, pull stations/history and login, for now it just uses S A M P L E T E X T)
- Populate stations button
- Plugins (?)
- """3d""" panels

#### Player pane:
 - Controls
 - Ratings
 - Settings icon (see below)
 - Album cover
 - Time slider
 - Volume slider
 - Sleep timer
 - Lyrics
 - ~~maybe maybe maybe airplay??? maybe? if that's even possible?~~ 
 Not possible currently
 - Queue view (?)

#### Stations panel:
- Search
- Play
- Put last played song in station as cover
- Grid mode
- List mode

#### History panel:
- Make buttons do stuff other than just look ~~good~~ ok
- ~~Grid mode~~ Done
- ~~List mode~~ Done
- ~~animation transitioning between the two~~ Done	

#### Options panel:
- actually exist
- plugins draglist (think iOS lists?)
- add accounts? I'm going to have to think on this
